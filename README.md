COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project is a simple Python-based data analysis and visualization tool for tracking the global spread of COVID-19. It utilizes the open-source COVID-19 dataset from [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data) to analyze and visualize key metrics like new cases, total cases, and total deaths across selected countries.

 Project Objectives
- Load and clean real-world COVID-19 data.
- Analyze trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths across different countries.
- Visualize the spread and impact of the virus using various chart types.
- Provide a quick and insightful snapshot of the pandemic’s global state.

Tools and Libraries Used
- Python – Programming language used
- Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib – Plotting library for basic graphs
- Seaborn – Advanced data visualization

How to Run the Project
1. Clone or Download the repository.
2. Install dependencies (use a virtual environment if desired):

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

Insights and Reflections
-Visualizing new daily cases over time shows distinct waves and surges in different countries.

-The cumulative case/death charts offer a clearer understanding of which countries are most impacted.

-This project demonstrates the power of public health data and simple visual tools in making complex patterns more understandable.

-Future enhancements could include real-time updates, interactive dashboards (e.g., with Streamlit), or forecasting trends with machine learning.
